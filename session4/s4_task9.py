##Given that radius is 2 and area is calculated as 12.5678, use string format operators to print the values of the variables radius and area so that the output looks like this:
##Radius is: 	          2
##Area is:	  12.57






radius = 2
area =    12.57

print("Radius is: %20s" % (radius))
print ("Area is: %27s" % (area) )
