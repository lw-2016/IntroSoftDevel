##Find two run-time errors:
##X = 2   # variable is declared as capital X   
##Y = 4  # variable is declared as capital Y
##variables with capital letters are not a problem however  program requires consistent naming.
##function print below has those variables in lower case.
##print("The product of ", x, "and", y, "is", x + y)

##print("The root of their difference is ", sqrt(x - y))
##second error is that there is no square root of negative number.
##square root of negative number cannot be expressed with real number.
##complex numbers solve this problem with imaginary number sqrt-1 =i


from math import sqrt
x=2
y=4
print ("The product of ", x, "and", y, "is" ,x + y)
#print ("The root of their difference is", sqrt(x - y))
